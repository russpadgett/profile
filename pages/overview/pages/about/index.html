						<h1 class="fw-bold mb-4 text-center">About Me</h1>

						<p class="lead text-center mb-4">Over 25 years of software development experience from startups to Fortune 100 companies, specializing in building applications using modern cloud-based architectures, microservices, containerization with Docker/Kubernetes, and AI-powered solutions.</p>

								<h3 class="h4 mb-3">My Journey</h3>
								<p class="text-muted">In 1995, I decided to be a professional software engineer, I grew my technical skills by doing side projects and part-time jobs, learning C, VB, ASP, and creating my first websites with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
								<p class="text-muted">By 2000, I acheived the level of Senior Software Engineer working for JPMorgan Chase creating software solutions with C# and .NET for mission critical applications.</p>
								<p class="text-muted">In 2010, I began working with Azure as a cloud provider for Callaway Golf, a few years later I was building containerized applications using Docker/Kubernetes, soon followed by serverless applications.</p>
								<p class="text-muted">Today, AI has revolutionized software development, and at GEICO, 
									I use AI for rapid code development, testing, documentation, and quality checks, ensuring the highest quality code is delivered for AI-powered solutions like AI enabled chatbots, AI powered document processing, and AI powered claims processing.</p>
								<p class="text-muted">From my first "Hello World" to architecting cloud applications with AI integration, every step has been a learning opportunity. The tech industry moves fast, and staying curious about new tools, methodologies, and best practices is what I do every day. I believe the best software is built by teams that value clean code, thoughtful design, and user-centric thinking.</p>
