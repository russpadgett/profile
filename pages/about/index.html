						<h1 class="display-4 fw-bold mb-4 text-center">About Me</h1>

						<p class="lead text-center mt-4 mb-5">Over 3 decades of software development experience with startups to Fortune 100 companies, specializing in building applications using modern cloud-based architectures, microservices, containerization with Docker/Kubernetes, and AI-powered solutions.</p>

								<h3 class="h4 mb-3">My Journey</h3>
								<p class="text-muted">I wrote my first lines of code when I was 15 years old using BASIC on my Commodore 64.</p>
								<p class="text-muted">Over the years, I grew my tech stack experience with personal projects and part-time jobs, learning C, Visual Basic, and building my first websites with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
								<p class="text-muted">In 1999, I acheived the level of Senior Software Engineer working for JPMorgan Chase creating software solutions with C# and .NET.</p>
								<p class="text-muted">In 2010, at Callaway Golf, I started working with Azure as a cloud provider, a few years later we were building containerized applications using Docker/Kubernetes, soon followed by serverless applications.</p>
								<p class="text-muted">In 2025, AI is revolutionizing software development, and at GEICO, we are leading the way with AI-powered solutions.</p>
								<p class="text-muted">From my first "Hello World" to architecting cloud applications with AI integration, every step has been a learning opportunity. The tech industry moves fast, and staying curious about new tools, methodologies, and best practices is what I do every day. I believe the best software is built by teams that value clean code, thoughtful design, and user-centric thinking.</p>

								<p class="card-text text-muted">When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new technologies through side projects, contributing to open-source initiatives, or conducting knowledge sharing presentations and mentoring junior developers.</p>
