						<p class="lead text-center mt-4 mb-5">
							With over 3 decades of experience in software development, 
							I've contributed to projects ranging from innovative startups to enterprise applications. 
							My passion lies in creating software that not only works but makes a meaningful impact.</p>

								<h3 class="h4 mb-3">My Journey</h3>
								<p class="text-muted">
									My first lines of code were in BASIC on my Commodore 64 when I was 15 years old.
									A decade later I was building websites with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript which lead to my professional career as a software developer creating scalable, efficient software solutions with C# and ASP.NET.
									The next decade came the introduction of cloud providers and building cloud based applications with containerization followed by serverless and building serverless applications.
									This decade has introduced AI and building applications with AI integrations.</p>
								<p class="text-muted">
									From my first "Hello World" to architecting cloud applications with AI integration, every step has been a learning opportunity. 
									Continuous learning isn't just a buzzword for me; it's essential. The tech industry moves fast, and staying curious about new tools, methodologies, and best practices is what I do every day.
									I believe the best software is built by teams that value clean code, thoughtful design, and user-centric thinking.</p>

								<h4 class="card-title mb-3">Beyond Code</h4>
								<p class="card-text text-muted">
									When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new technologies through side projects, contributing to open-source initiatives, or conducting knowledge sharing presentations and mentoring junior developers.</p>
